# myGit: the Hubbining

## Abstract
myGit: the Hubbening is an application designed to view cards from the newest set from Magic: the Gathering. On load the cards of all 5 colors will load in. They can be further sorted down by color selection, clicked to view the card and added to a collection. 

#### Goals and Objectives
- Use the technology youâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of the following:
  - React, Router, Asynchronous JavaScript, End to end testing with Cypress
- Create personas and user stories to describe your target audience.

- Work within constraints to deliver a product for your niche audience, which helps solve a problem unique to them.

- Your applications must have the following core functionality:
  - Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to your audience
  - Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application, such as favoriting or adding to a list, searching, commenting, etc
  - Multiple views handled by Router
  - Be deployed using Heroku, Surge, or any other similar service

## Features
- Renders card from the Brothers War set of M:tG cards
- Cards can be sorted by colors
- Cards can be view in full and added to a collection
- Collection will display saved cards, which can be removed

## Possible Future Extensions
- Card Ratings
- Deck Building

#### Milestones
- I had a long and hard fight with my API data every step of the way through. This was the single most challenging individual project for me so far for this reason. I learned that how you chose the data structures to use for app creation can be the single largest blocker to success.
- I was able to properly implement Prop Types alone, which were not as terrifying ass i assumed.
- I implemented data rendering on a table, which was a small thing that I somehow missed in my ealrier mods.

#### Challenges 
- Data - every aspect of it was difficult and infuriating. But I feel that I did learn a lot about how to interpret and use more complex data throughout the sprint.
- Cypress - Specifically stubbing fixture data. Due to a complicated Promise.all i was nearly unable to get the data to render in Cypress without reverting to my API call.
- Data matching - in retrospect I chose an entire too large/ complex an API for the scope fo this project, but was ultimately more successful than I thought I would be heading into this weekend.
